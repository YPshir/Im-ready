# datamining-project  
## introduction

This project was written as part of the course "Data Mining" during my degree.  
the full project is in the 
'[project.ipynb](https://github.com/YPshir/datamining-project/blob/master/project.ipynb)' file.  
you can see an introduction in the 
'[read me.pdf](https://github.com/YPshir/datamining-project/blob/master/read%20me.pdf)' file.

  ## Implementation  
  For this project in the "Data Mining" course - I chose a topic and database for which we will perform the process.
  ###  Data Mining  
  Data mining is the practice of automatically searching large stores of data to discover patterns and trends that go beyond simple       analysis. Data mining uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms to segment the data and evaluate the probability of future events.     Data mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD).
  ##### The key properties of data mining are:
  * Automatic discovery of patterns  
  * Prediction of likely outcomes  
  * Creation of actionable information  
  * Focus on large data sets and databases  
  * Data mining can answer questions that cannot be addressed through simple query and reporting techniques.
  
  
  ### Programming language and tools  
  I wrote this project in the Python software language in the Jupyter Notebook environment, which contains many directories for   realizing and executing data mining processes.
