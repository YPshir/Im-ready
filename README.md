# datamining-project  
## introduction

This project was written as part of the course "Data Mining" during my degree.  
the full project is in the 
'[project.ipynb](https://github.com/YPshir/datamining-project/blob/master/project.ipynb)' file.

  ## Implementation  
  For this project in the "Data Mining" course - I chose a topic and database for which we will perform the process.
  ###  Data Mining  
  Data mining is the practice of automatically searching large stores of data to discover patterns and trends that go beyond simple       analysis. Data mining uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms to segment the data and evaluate the probability of future events.     Data mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD).
  ##### The key properties of data mining are:
  * Automatic discovery of patterns  
  * Prediction of likely outcomes  
  * Creation of actionable information  
  * Focus on large data sets and databases  
  * Data mining can answer questions that cannot be addressed through simple query and reporting techniques.
  
  ### Programming language and tools  
  I wrote this project in the Python software language in the Jupyter Notebook environment, which contains many directories for   realizing and executing data mining processes.   
  
  ### *[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)*      
  Pandas is an open-source Python package that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the   labeled data in Python programming language. Pandas stand for Python Data Analysis Library.   
  Pandas is a perfect tool for data wrangling or munging. It is designed for quick and easy data manipulation, reading, aggregation, and visualization.
Pandas take data in a CSV or TSV file or a SQL database and create a Python object with rows and columns called a data frame. The data frame is very similar to a table in statistical software, say Excel or SPSS.  
###### I used Pandas in the processes:  
  1. Indexing, manipulating, renaming, sorting, merging data frame  
  2. Update, Add, Delete columns from a data frame  
  3. Impute missing files, handle missing data or NANs  
  4. Plot data with histogram or box plot  
  
  ### *[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)*      
One of the most fundamental packages in Python, NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides high-performance multidimensional array objects and tools to work with the arrays. NumPy is an efficient container of generic multi-dimensional data.
NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table of elements or numbers of the same datatype, indexed by a tuple of positive integers. In NumPy, dimensions are called axes and the number of axes is called rank. NumPy’s array class is called ndarray aka array.  
###### I used NumPy in the processes:  
  1. Basic array operations: add, multiply, slice, flatten, reshape, index arrays  
  2. Advanced array operations: stack arrays, split into sections, broadcast arrays  
  3. Work with DateTime or Linear Algebra  
  4. Basic Slicing and Advanced Indexing in NumPy Python  
  
  ### *[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)*      
The SciPy library is one of the core packages that make up the SciPy stack. SciPy builds on the NumPy array object and is part of the stack which includes tools like Matplotlib, Pandas, and SymPy with additional tools,
SciPy library contains modules for efficient mathematical routines as linear algebra, interpolation, optimization, integration, and statistics. The main functionality of the SciPy library is built upon NumPy and its arrays. SciPy makes significant use of NumPy.  
###### I used SciPy in the processes:  
 scipy.cluster.hierarchy for the hierarchy module provides functions for hierarchical and agglomerative clustering. Its features include generating hierarchical clusters from distance matrices, calculating statistics on clusters, cutting linkages to generate flat clusters, and visualizing clusters with dendrograms.
