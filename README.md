# ‘I’m ready’  
***An analysis of death row inmates data sets collection with a fixed set of attributes.
   such as: race, gender, education level, their victims profile and their recent statements.***  
   ***-Language and packages:*** Python,  Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplolib, Scikit Learn, NLTK.  
   ***-Algorithms:*** Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Nearest neighbor, Linear regression, etc.  

the full project is in the 
'[project.ipynb](https://github.com/YPshir/datamining-project/blob/master/project.ipynb)' file.  
  
  ### Main Tools  
 This project was written in Python. Used the Jupyter Notebook environment for realizing and executing data mining processes.   
  
  ### *[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)*      
  
###### Used Pandas for:  
  1. Indexing, manipulating, renaming, sorting, merging data frame  
  2. Update, Add, Delete columns from a data frame  
  3. Impute missing files, handle missing data or NANs  
  4. Plot data with histogram or box plot  
  
  ### *[NumPy](https://numpy.org/)*      
  
###### Used NumPy for:  
  1. Basic array operations: add, multiply, slice, flatten, reshape, index arrays  
  2. Advanced array operations: stack arrays, split into sections, broadcast arrays  
  3. Work with DateTime or Linear Algebra  
  4. Basic Slicing and Advanced Indexing in NumPy Python  
  
  ### *[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)*      
 
###### Used SciPy for:  
 Generating hierarchical clusters from distance matrices, Calculating statistics on clusters, Cutting linkages to generate flat clusters and Visualizing clusters with dendrograms.  
 
   ### *[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)*      
  
###### Used Matplotlib for:  
Histogram, Bar Charts, Scatter Plots, Area Plot to Pie Plot, Scatter Plots and Pie Charts.  

  ### *[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)*      
 
###### Used Seaborn for:  
  1. Determine relationships between multiple variables (correlation)  
  2. Analyze uni-variate or bi-variate distributions and compare them between different data subsets  
  3. Plot linear regression models for dependent variables  
  4. Provide high-level abstractions, multi-plot grids  
  
  ### *[Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)*      
  
###### Used Scikit Learn for:  
  1. Classification: Spam detection, image recognition  
  2. Clustering: Drug response, Stock price  
  3. Regression: Customer segmentation, Grouping experiment outcomes  
  4. Dimensionality reduction: Visualization, Increased efficiency  
  5. Model selection: Improved accuracy via parameter tuning  
  6. Pre-processing: Preparing input data as a text for processing with machine learning algorithms.  
  
 
   ### *[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)*    

###### Used NLTK for:  
 1. Find out the Most common words from the latest statements of the death row candidates and sort them by each race of those candidates.  
 2. Display the most frequent 100 words not related to the diffrents races (by using WordCloud package).  
 3. Used Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to sort out the letters of confessions by negative, positive and neutral emotions.  
 4. Gender prediction of inmates by their first name using the n-gram algorithm.  
  
 

 ## Conclusion
 * Gender - The gender of the victims is divided relatively evenly.  
 * Race - Most of the defendants are of a white race similar to the race distribution in the country.  
          A positive correlation was found between the race of the accused and the race of his victim, contrary to the prevailing hypothesis - "race war".
 * Education - The vast majority of the defendants had 12 years of schooling and even some went on to higher education.  
 * Criminal record - About half of the defendants do not have a criminal record and this is their first criminal offense.  
 * Text Mining - Most of the statements contained words related to family life and names of relatives (parents / children). Also, the word God has been mentioned frequently.         
                 80 percent of recent statements have a positive connotation despite the difficult situation they are in - their execution.
