# datamining-project  
## introduction

This project was written as part of the course "Data Mining" during my degree.  
the full project is in the 
'[project.ipynb](https://github.com/YPshir/datamining-project/blob/master/project.ipynb)' file.  
you can see an introduction in the 
'[read me.pdf](https://github.com/YPshir/datamining-project/blob/master/read%20me.pdf)' file.

  ## Implementation  
  For this project in the "Data Mining" course - I chose a topic and database for which we will perform the process.
  ###  Data Mining  
  Data mining is the practice of automatically searching large stores of data to discover patterns and trends that go beyond simple       analysis. Data mining uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms to segment the data and evaluate the probability of future events.     Data mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD).
  ##### The key properties of data mining are:
  * Automatic discovery of patterns  
  * Prediction of likely outcomes  
  * Creation of actionable information  
  * Focus on large data sets and databases  
  * Data mining can answer questions that cannot be addressed through simple query and reporting techniques.
  
  ### Programming language and tools  
  I wrote this project in the Python software language in the Jupyter Notebook environment, which contains many directories for   realizing and executing data mining processes.   
  
  ### *[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)*      
  Pandas is an open-source Python package that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the   labeled data in Python programming language. Pandas stand for Python Data Analysis Library.   
  Pandas is a perfect tool for data wrangling or munging. It is designed for quick and easy data manipulation, reading, aggregation, and visualization.
Pandas take data in a CSV or TSV file or a SQL database and create a Python object with rows and columns called a data frame. The data frame is very similar to a table in statistical software, say Excel or SPSS.  
###### I used Pandas in the processes:  
  1. Indexing, manipulating, renaming, sorting, merging data frame  
  2. Update, Add, Delete columns from a data frame  
  3. Impute missing files, handle missing data or NANs  
  4. Plot data with histogram or box plot
